# Neo Jobs - Job Portal

## Developed using MERN Stack

### Request to Consider

There is a release rollout going on in my current company. I have to work there hard for the whole week and even on weekend. So, I did not get the time to implement all the features as described in the Instruction PDF and there are some bugs in this web app as I developed it in a few hours.

But I can explain how I can implement the other features mentioned in the instruction manual if necessary.
